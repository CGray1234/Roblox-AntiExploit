# Roblox-AntiExploit
This is an anti exploit I use on my ROBLOX games.

I got this script from Nadeku on YouTube, consider giving him some love for this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-MRR4Bg3fKsPz4YDQACLSQ

**THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS AS THIS INTERFERES WITH A LOT OF THE GAME'S CODE**

**ALL FOLDERS, SCRIPTS, AND EVENTS MUST BE NAMED AS STATED BELOW**

**DATASTORES MUST BE ENABLED FOR THE BANS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY**

To find the players folder in a script, do NOT put game.Players; put game:GetService("Players"). Same goes for ReplicatedStorage, ServerScriptService, etc. Workspace can be put into scripts as: workspace

# To use:

Place a LocalScript into StarterPlayerScripts, and paste the code provided in the StarterPlayerScripts file.

Place a FOLDER into ReplicatedStorage and name it RemoteEvents. Put 2 remote events into the folder, and name them ChatMessageEvent and ClientKick. Place another folder seperate from the RemoteEvents folder and name it ClientBanEvent. Put 1 RemoteEvent in the ClientBanEvent and call it Ban.

Put a FOLDER into ServerScriptService and name it Scripts. Put a script into the folder and name it AntiExploit. Put the code from the ServerAntiExploit file into the script. Put a LocalScript into the AntiExploit script and name it ClientAntiExploit. Put the code from the ClientAntiExploit file into the LocalScript.

Place another FOLDER into ServerScriptService and name it ClientBanExecutorFolder. Put a script into the folder and name it ClientBanScript. Paste the code from the ClientBanHandler file into the ClientBanScript.

The last step is to change the ban messages to whatever you want, and put the UserIds of admins (including the game owner) into the admin table found in the AntiExploit and ClientAntiExploit scripts.
